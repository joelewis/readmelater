                    Are you not able to close those dozens of tabs in your browser, because you are afraid you might forget them forever?
                    Maybe it's a really long article or a group of related tabs from your recent research â€“ now you can just <u>#tag</u> them, <u>set a time out</u> and we'll make sure you finish consuming those tabs <u>in time</u>.

                  Most people bookmark links for coming back later. But most of us lack the disclipline to actually come back.
                <!-- </p>
                <p> -->
                  That is why people have several tabs open even though they work actively only on a few tabs.

                  CloseTab solves this problem by being a little smarter to remind you to come back, while also gently keeping track of your reading list.
